\subsection{Method}

To get more knowledge and experience about the different GPU environments, the first phase of the thesis work will involve individual work with CUDA, OpenCL and GLSL. The middle phase of the project will be the implementation of all the software components. This will be an iterative process. First a prototype will be created and after feedback from a supervisor and other people involved in the project, a second improved version will be implemented. For every feature added in the backend library, a unit test is added to test the feature and all its cases. The last part of the thesis work will involve testing and more specifically, testing with practical image processing problems. The testing part serves the purpose of benchmarking speed, testing how practical the framework is and examine if any GPU environment is better than the others in terms of functionality.
