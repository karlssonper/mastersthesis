\subsection{Method}

The first phase of the thesis work will involved individual work with CUDA, OpenCL and GLSL to gain more knowledge about the different GPU environments. The middle phase of the project was the implementation of all the software components. This was an iterative process. First a prototype was created and after feedback from a supervisor and other people involved in the project, a second improved version was implemented. For every feature added in the backend library, a unit test was added to test the different cases. The last part of the thesis work involved testing and more specifically, testing with practical image processing problems. The testing part served the purpose of benchmarking performance, testing how practical the framework is and examined if any GPU environment is better than the others in terms of functionality.
